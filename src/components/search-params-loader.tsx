// nextjs requires that we wrap anything that needs the useSearchParams hook in
// Suspense. since I only need the params for things that occur after the load
// is finished (e.g. form submission) and I don't want to block the UI w/
// suspense, this is a good, childless way of hoisting the params back up to the
// parent component that needs them in a non-UI blocking way
